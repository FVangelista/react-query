# React Query

To keep the react data Sync with the server a good approach could be to implement the state management react-query library, it simplifies the process of fetching, caching and updating... (https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview) in react applications.

## Tasks List application

This app is a simple task list app to experiment with the library managing errors and loading time, you can add a task, edit it by clicking the checkboxes as well as delete it.

To check out this application the local server needs to be running and instead of "<b>npm start</b>" you can use the script "<b>npm run local-server</b>" so the tasks will be saved on the file system since I did not use a database. Then go to the starter folder and run "<b>npm run dev</b>".

## Conclusion

I enjoy using it and I'll try to make more use of it in my future projects and experiment with its features to deal with data that is stored remotely.
